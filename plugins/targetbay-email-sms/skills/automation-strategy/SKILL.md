name: automation-strategy
description: Use when the question is which automations a store should have at all — auditing the whole automation portfolio, finding lifecycle stages with no coverage, deciding which existing journeys should be split, consolidated, extended or retired, and sequencing that work by expected value. Use this before automation-architect, which designs the topology of a single objective once this skill has decided the objective is worth building.

# Automation Strategy

## Purpose

Decide the store's automation portfolio: what exists, what is missing, what is redundant, and what to
build first.

This is the portfolio view. It answers *which journeys should exist* and in what order they are worth
building. [automation-architect](../automation-architect/SKILL.md) then answers *what each one should
look like*.

## When to Use

- A store asks what automations it should have, or whether its current set is adequate
- Onboarding a store and establishing its automation baseline
- A periodic review of automation coverage and performance
- Revenue is flat and the suspicion is structural gaps rather than campaign quality
- Several automations appear to overlap and someone must decide what to merge
- Another skill needs the automation landscape before planning

## When Not to Use

- One objective is already agreed and needs a topology. Use
  [automation-architect](../automation-architect/SKILL.md).
- One journey underperforms and needs tuning. Use
  [automation-optimization](../automation-optimization/SKILL.md).
- The question is about scheduled sends rather than triggered journeys. Use
  [monthly-marketing-planner](../monthly-marketing-planner/SKILL.md).

## Required Context

| Context | Why it is needed | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Complete list of existing automations with topology and status | The entire audit rests on it | Blocked |
| Automation performance: entry, completion, revenue per entrant | Ranks existing journeys | Partial; coverage only, no value ranking |
| Lifecycle distribution and stage thresholds | Locates gaps and sizes them | Blocked |
| Order history: repeat interval, frequency, AOV | Reveals which transitions leak | Partial |
| Product and category structure | Identifies product-driven journey needs | Product journeys not proposed |
| Campaign performance | Shows where manual sends are simulating a trigger | Partial |
| Store objectives and constraints | Orders the roadmap | Ranking defaults to expected revenue |

## Required MCP Capabilities

Defined in [../../capabilities.yaml](../../capabilities.yaml); tool mappings **TODO** —
[../../docs/mcp-integration.md](../../docs/mcp-integration.md).

| Capability | Used for |
|---|---|
| `email_sms.store_profile` | Vertical, scale, sending posture |
| `email_sms.customer_intelligence` | Lifecycle distribution, transition leakage, value concentration |
| `email_sms.product_intelligence` | Catalogue shape, categories, replenishable products |
| `email_sms.order_intelligence` | Repeat intervals, frequency, AOV distribution |
| `email_sms.segmentation` | Sizing candidate journey audiences |
| `email_sms.automation` | Reading the existing portfolio |
| `email_sms.automation_analytics` | Per-journey and per-node performance |
| `email_sms.campaign_analytics` | Detecting manual sends that should be automations |

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `objectives` | no | Store priorities. Defaults to expected revenue impact |
| `time_horizon` | no | How far out the roadmap should plan |
| `constraints` | no | Team capacity, channel restrictions, brand limits |
| `scope` | no | Restrict to a lifecycle stage, channel or product line |
| `playbook` | no | Vertical overlay |

## Decision Process

```
Understand business             ← objectives, vertical, constraints
        ↓
Understand customers            ← lifecycle distribution, where the leaks are
        ↓
Understand products             ← replenishable, seasonal, high-consideration
        ↓
Understand existing automations ← topology, status, performance
        ↓
Identify lifecycle gaps         ← which transitions have no coverage
        ↓
Identify audience differences   ← which groups need their own journeys
        ↓
Determine automation variants   ← delegate topology questions to automation-architect
        ↓
Determine topology / timing / channels   ← per selected journey
        ↓
Validate                        ← overlap, cadence, capacity
        ↓
Produce roadmap                 ← ordered by expected value, with dependencies
```

## Decision Rules

Binding: [../../rules/automation-rules.md](../../rules/automation-rules.md),
[../../rules/global-rules.md](../../rules/global-rules.md),
[../../rules/frequency-rules.md](../../rules/frequency-rules.md).

**Finding gaps**

- Walk the lifecycle transitions in
  [../../knowledge/customer-lifecycle.md](../../knowledge/customer-lifecycle.md) and mark each as covered,
  partially covered, or absent.
- Size every gap before recommending it. An uncovered transition affecting a handful of contacts is not a
  priority.
- A manual campaign repeatedly sent to simulate a behavioural trigger is a gap (C11).

**Deciding what to build**

- Rank by expected value: audience size × expected effect × durability, against build and maintenance cost.
- Prefer fixing a leaking existing journey over adding a new one — the audience is already flowing through it.
- Coverage before sophistication. A store missing post-purchase entirely does not need a VIP micro-journey.

**Splitting and consolidating**

- Split only when [../../rules/automation-rules.md#R4](../../rules/automation-rules.md) passes.
- Consolidate when two journeys trigger on the same event with near-identical content (R6).
- Retire journeys that no longer earn their maintenance, after reporting what is lost (S6).

**Sequencing**

- Order by value, but respect dependencies: segments before journeys that need them, data before
  personalisation that depends on it.
- Cap concurrent work at what the store can actually build and measure.

## Workflow

| Phase | Action | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| DISCOVER | Read portfolio, lifecycle, orders, products, campaigns | `read_only` |
| ANALYZE | Map coverage, size gaps, rank existing journeys, find overlaps | `analysis` |
| PLAN | Select and order journeys to build, fix, merge or retire | `plan` |
| PREVIEW | Present the roadmap with evidence per item | `plan` |
| VALIDATE | Run the checks below | `plan` |
| APPROVE | Human selects what proceeds | — |
| EXECUTE | Delegate each selected journey to [automation-architect](../automation-architect/SKILL.md) | `plan` → `mutation` |
| MEASURE | Re-run after the built journeys accumulate volume | — |

## Expected Output

A [skill result](../../schemas/skill-result.schema.json) containing:

1. **Coverage map** — each lifecycle transition marked covered / partial / absent, with audience size
2. **Existing portfolio assessment** — per journey: performance, verdict (keep, fix, split, merge, retire), evidence
3. **Ranked roadmap** — ordered recommendations conforming to
   [../../schemas/recommendation.schema.json](../../schemas/recommendation.schema.json), each with expected
   outcome, dependencies and risks
4. **Explicitly rejected journeys** — considered and not recommended, with reasons

No fixed number of recommendations. A store with good coverage may correctly receive two.

## Validation

- [ ] Every existing automation read and assessed, none silently ignored
- [ ] Every gap sized against `email_sms.segmentation` (A1)
- [ ] Every recommendation carries evidence with period and sample size (G2, G14)
- [ ] No recommendation duplicates an existing journey (G6)
- [ ] Overlaps between recommended journeys identified with precedence (R16)
- [ ] Combined cadence of the roadmap checked against existing contact volume (F2, F3)
- [ ] Roadmap ordered, with dependencies stated
- [ ] Rejected candidates recorded
- [ ] No invented performance figures (G3)

## Approval Requirements

| Action | Risk | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| Audit the portfolio | `read_only` | None |
| Produce the roadmap | `plan` | None |
| Build a recommended journey | `mutation` | Per journey, via automation-architect |
| Activate any journey | `high_impact` | Explicit, per journey |
| Merge or retire an existing journey | `destructive` | Explicit, after reporting what is lost (S6) |

## Examples

**"What automations do we need?"**
Finds five live automations, three of them effectively duplicates of each other triggering on the same
event. Coverage map shows first-time → repeat entirely uncovered, which is also where the largest
customer leak sits. Roadmap: merge the three duplicates, build a second-purchase journey, then
replenishment for the two replenishable categories. Four other candidates rejected on size.

**"Should we split our abandoned cart automation by price?"**
Sizes the high-value tail, checks whether treatment would genuinely differ, and finds it would — the
high-value band justifies SMS follow-up that the rest does not. Recommends a split with the threshold
derived from the store's own AOV distribution, not a round number.

## Failure Handling

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| `email_sms.automation` unavailable | **Blocked.** The audit is the skill |
| Automation analytics unavailable | **Partial.** Coverage map only; say the ranking is structural, not performance-based |
| New store, no automations | Return a coverage-first baseline roadmap ordered by lifecycle, marked as pre-data |
| Lifecycle data thin | **Partial.** Use order recency directly and say the stage boundaries are provisional |
| Very large portfolio | Assess all, report the ranked subset, and state how many were reviewed |
| Store constraints unknown | Ask once for capacity; otherwise rank on value and flag the assumption |

Degraded outcomes set `status` accordingly and populate `unmet_requirements`.
